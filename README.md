# vaults
This repository is a template for the vaults as they can be used with obsidian. Clone this directory /home (C:\Users\<your user> on Windows). Automatically created files (shortcut: <leader> + o + t) will be placed in "daily", depending whether the root directory is personal, or work.

# Example workflow
The following order of execution would be a practical scenario of using this template repo together with the obsidian plugin:
```
git clone https://github.com/SoftwareShenzheneer/vaults.git
cd vaults/work
nvim .
<leader> + o + t
```
This puts you inside a new template ready to write and will be saved in ./work/daily.
